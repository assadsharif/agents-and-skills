# SDD Git Commit/PR Agent

Autonomous agent for Git workflows using the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology.

## When to Use This Agent

### ✅ Use sdd-git-commit-pr agent when:
- Committing completed implementation work
- Creating pull requests for feature branches
- Following proper Git commit message conventions
- Generating PR descriptions from commits and artifacts
- Linking PRs to specs, plans, and issues
- Ensuring clean Git history

### ❌ Use sp.git.commit_pr skill instead when:
- Quick reference to Git workflow
- Understanding commit message format
- Manual Git operations

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Commit Workflow

**Autonomous workflow:**
```
1. Run git status to see changes
2. Run git diff to review changes
3. Run git log to see recent commit style
4. Analyze changes:
   - Determine change type (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore)
   - Identify affected components
   - Extract key modifications
5. Draft commit message following convention:
   - <type>(<scope>): <subject>
   - Optional body with details
   - Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
6. Stage relevant files (avoid secrets, large binaries)
7. Create commit with formatted message
8. Run git status after commit to verify
9. Report commit hash and summary
```

**Usage:**
```
"/sp.git.commit_pr Commit user authentication implementation"
```

---

### 2. Pull Request Creation

**Autonomous workflow:**
```
1. Verify current branch and commits
2. Check if branch tracks remote
3. Push branch to remote if needed (with -u flag)
4. Gather PR context:
   - Read feature spec (spec.md)
   - Read implementation plan (plan.md)
   - Review commit history for branch
   - Extract user stories completed
5. Generate structured PR description:
   - Summary (1-3 sentences)
   - User stories/features completed
   - Technical changes
   - Testing performed
   - Links to artifacts (spec, plan, ADRs)
   - Checklist for reviewers
6. Create PR using gh pr create
7. Return PR URL
```

**Usage:**
```
"Create pull request for user authentication feature"
```

---

### 3. Commit Message Generation

**Autonomous workflow:**
```
1. Analyze git diff output
2. Determine commit type:
   - feat: New feature
   - fix: Bug fix
   - refactor: Code refactoring
   - docs: Documentation
   - test: Test additions
   - chore: Maintenance
3. Identify scope (component/module affected)
4. Write subject (< 70 chars, imperative mood)
5. Add body if needed (explain why, not what)
6. Add Co-Authored-By footer
7. Format using HEREDOC for proper multiline
```

**Usage:**
```
"Generate commit message for authentication changes"
```

---

### 4. PR Description Generation

**Autonomous workflow:**
```
1. Load artifacts:
   - spec.md: User stories and requirements
   - plan.md: Technical approach
   - tasks.md: Completed tasks
   - ADRs: Architectural decisions
2. Extract from git log:
   - All commits since branch diverged from main
   - Commit messages and scopes
   - Files changed
3. Generate sections:
   - ## Summary: High-level overview
   - ## Features: User-facing changes
   - ## Technical Changes: Implementation details
   - ## Testing: Tests added/run
   - ## Artifacts: Links to spec, plan, ADRs
   - ## Checklist: Reviewer tasks
4. Format as markdown
5. Include "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" footer
```

**Usage:**
```
"Generate PR description from commits and artifacts"
```

---

### 5. Git Safety Checks

**Autonomous workflow:**
```
1. Never update git config
2. Never run destructive commands without explicit user request:
   - push --force
   - reset --hard
   - checkout .
   - restore .
   - clean -f
   - branch -D
3. Never skip hooks (--no-verify) unless user explicitly requests
4. Never force push to main/master (warn user if requested)
5. Stage specific files by name (not "git add -A" or ".")
6. Always create NEW commits (not --amend) unless user explicitly requests
7. Check for sensitive files before staging (.env, credentials)
8. Verify git status after operations
```

**Usage:**
```
"Commit changes with safety checks"
```

---

## Execution Strategy

### Commit Message Convention

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Types:**
- **feat**: New feature for the user
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance (dependencies, build, etc.)

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow supporting Google and GitHub
providers. Users can now log in using their social accounts instead
of creating new credentials.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

```bash
fix(auth): prevent duplicate email registration

Add unique constraint check before creating user accounts to prevent
race condition where duplicate emails could be registered simultaneously.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Recovery

**1. Pre-commit Hook Failure**
```bash
# Error: Pre-commit hook failed (linting, formatting)
# Recovery:
Fix reported issues (run linter, formatter)
Re-stage fixed files
Create NEW commit (not --amend to avoid destroying previous commits)
```

**2. Branch Not Tracking Remote**
```bash
# Error: Current branch has no upstream
# Recovery:
Push with upstream: git push -u origin <branch-name>
Then create PR
```

**3. PR Already Exists**
```bash
# Error: Pull request already exists for this branch
# Recovery:
Run: gh pr list --head <branch-name>
Ask user: "PR exists. Update existing PR or close and recreate?"
```

**4. Sensitive Files Staged**
```bash
# Error: Attempting to commit .env or credentials
# Recovery:
Unstage sensitive files
Warn user about security risk
Add to .gitignore if not present
Create commit without sensitive files
```

## Integration with SDD Workflow

### When to Commit

**After completing:**
- User story implementation
- Phase completion in tasks.md
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Documentation updates

**Commit granularity:**
- One commit per logical change
- One commit per user story (if small)
- Multiple commits for large stories

---

### When to Create PR

**After completing:**
- Full feature (all user stories)
- Single user story (for incremental review)
- Significant milestone
- Bug fix ready for review

**PR scope:**
- Prefer smaller, focused PRs
- One PR per user story is ideal
- Large features can have multiple PRs
