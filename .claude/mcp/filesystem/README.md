## 🆚 Filesystem MCP vs Bash Commands

| Feature | Filesystem MCP | Bash (cat/ls/etc) |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Interface** | Natural language | Command-line |
| **Safety** | Sandboxed | Full system access |
| **File Reading** | "Read the file" | `cat file.txt` |
| **File Writing** | "Write to file" | `echo > file.txt` |
| **Directory Listing** | "List directory" | `ls -la` |
| **Context Aware** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Multi-Step Tasks** | ✅ Yes | Manual |

**When to use MCP:** File operations within project scope, safe access
**When to use Bash:** System operations, git commands, package management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Not Connected

**Problem:** `filesystem - ✗ Failed to connect`

**Solution:**
1. Check that npx is installed: `which npx`
2. Test manual run: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem .`
3. Restart Claude Code

### Permission Denied

**Problem:** "Permission denied" when accessing files

**Solution:**
- Ensure the file path is within the allowed directory
- Check file system permissions
- Verify the directory exists

### Path Not Allowed

**Problem:** "Path not in allowed directories"

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're only accessing files within the configured directory
- Check for symlinks pointing outside the allowed directory
- Verify the path doesn't use `../` to escape the sandbox
